# Decentralized Applications (d-App)
## Projects
1. A decentralized Ethereum [voting application](https://github.com/BlueSky0322/Decentralised-Apps/tree/election-app) using Solidity, Truffle and Ganache. 
2. A decentralized Ethereum [mobile notes application](https://github.com/BlueSky0322/Decentralised-Apps/tree/notes-app-mobile) using Flutter, Solidity, Truffle and Ganache

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* [Solidity (extension on VS Code)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity)
* [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)
* [Truffle (using npm)](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/how-to/install/)

### Info
- Solidity
  * Solidity is the programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
  * Provides the syntax and features necessary for smart contract coding.
- Truffle
  * Truffle is a development framework for Ethereum.
  * Provides a suite of tools and utilities to simplify the development, testing, and deployment of smart contracts.
  * CLI interface for automated contract compilation, deployment to different networks, contract unit testing, and migration management
- Ganache
  * Ganache is a personal Ethereum blockchain for development and testing purposes.
  * Allows local Ethereum network deployment for testing smart contracts without the need for a public Ethereum network.
